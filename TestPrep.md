# Test Preparation

## Preparing PDFs for printing

1. Open the Cover Sheet Word document
1. Print each page individually to a PDF using *Microsoft Print to PDF*, saving each file with the test name as the file name (e.g. `MATHEMATICS.pdf`).
1. Print each test to PDF, saving each file with the same name as the `docx` file. If USAD provided a PDF of the math test, use that instead of creating a PDF.
1. Open pdfEdit995
1. Select the Combine/Extract tab.
1. Click *Combine existing PDFs...*
1. Add the cover sheet then the test PDF
1. Save the result as `Printable XX.pdf` where `XX` is the test file name (e.g. `Printable Social Science Round 2 v.2 19-20.pdf`)
1. Verify the math test does not contain answers. USAD provides a PDF of the math test with answers.
