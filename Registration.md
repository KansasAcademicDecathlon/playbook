# Registration Form

## Creating The Form

Using Google Sheets, create one master form named *YYYY Kansas Academic Decathlon Regional Scrimmage* where *YYYY* is the year of the competition.
The form contains the following information

* Season (*2021 - 2022 Kansas Academic Decathlon*)
* The name of the competition (*Northeast Kansas Regional Scrimmage* or *State Competition*)
* [Due Date](#due-date)
* Instructions for filling out the sheet
* School drop-down box
* Costs
* Address for sending checks (See [Payments](#payments))
* A table with the following columns
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Category drop down
    * HONORS
    * SCHOLASTIC
    * VARSITY
    * Coach
    * Volunteer
  * GPA
  * Grade Level drop down
    * 9
    * 10
    * 11
    * 12

The sheet stores drop-down values on a secondary tab (called List Values).

The first table entry is the coach's name. The sheet automatically populates it from the School drop-down.

## Due Date

The due date is typically Monday before the competition for online testing. For in-person competitions, the due date is two weeks prior. Two weeks are needed to handle modifications or late registrations. It also allows enough time to order printed tests, food, [plaques](Awards.md), and answer blanks.

## Costs

### In-Person Competition

Per decathlete costs
* answer sheets
* printed tests
* lunch

Shared costs
* plaques for Super Quiz
* plaques for the top three teams (state only)
* refreshments for volunteers
* ribbons
* medals for state competition

### Online competition

Online regional scrimmage does not require plaques (no Super Quiz). The only costs are for ribbons and their shipping. Kansas builds the online fee for testing into the registration fees for State.

Online state competition requires money to cover the cost of online testing through USAD, [awards](Awards.md), and shipping.

## Payment

Payment is due on the day of the competition.
Not all schools will pay on time.
Some schools require an invoice before they can issue payment.
Many schools are moving to credit/debit cards to pay for activities.
KSAD has a [Square](https://squareup.com/) account to generate invoices and accept payment via credit/debit cards.
Keep track of how much each school owes and if they have paid.
Some schools will need a reminder to send their payment.
