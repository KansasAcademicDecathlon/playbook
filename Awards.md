## Handout

Include a note when sending the awards containing the following:
> There are Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals for the top three scoring students on your team.
>
> The ribbons are for the individual awards listed on the included sheet.

For the state competition, add the following:

> There are Gold/Silver/Bronze medals for each team member since your team placed at the state competition for Kansas.

## Shipping

Plaques weigh more than 16oz, so First Class Mail isnâ€™t an option.
Therefore use the Priority Mail 9.5 x 12.5 flat rate padded envelopes.
$100 is enough to cover the cost of the awards so no supplemental insurance is needed.
For the others, First Class is probably less expensive.
